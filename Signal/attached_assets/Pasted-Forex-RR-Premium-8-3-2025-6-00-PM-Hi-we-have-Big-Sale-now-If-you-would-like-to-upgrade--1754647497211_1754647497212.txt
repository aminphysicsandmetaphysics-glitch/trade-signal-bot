Remember to use proper risk management when opening your trades.

Poor risk management and incorrect lot sizes are often key reasons why many traders fail - and we want you to succeed!

We recommend risking a maximum of 1-2% per trade and keeping total risk across all open positions below 10%.

You can calculate the correct lot size using our calculator:

Today is Friday, we don’t expect much market movement. Additionally, we plan to close all open trades before the market closes - so there will be fewer signals than usual today.

We’ll send an update here when it’s the best time to close all open trades.

Thank you and enjoy the start of the weekend! ✅
